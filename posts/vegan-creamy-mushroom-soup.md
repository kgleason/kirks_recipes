An earthy soup -- tastes of mushrooms and awesome. This makes a lot of soup. You might want to cut it all in half.

As I've got it here, it is vegan, gluten free, and dairy free. It does have soy.

## Ingedients

* 2 T vegan butter, margarine, or coconut oil
* 3&frac12; lbs sliced mushrooms
* &frac12; lb sliced portabello mushroom (the big ones)
* 2 small white onions
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1&frac12; qt low sodium vegetable broth
* 1 qt unsweetened soy milk
* 2 c vegan miso broth
* 12 oz vegan sour cream
* 3 T potato starch
* salt & pepper to taste

## Preraration

1. Put the fat into a large stock pot and melt it over high heat
1. Add a 1 cup or so of the vegetable broth
1. When the broth boils, turn the temperature down and toss in the onion, garlic, and all of the sliced mushroom, but not the big portabellos.
1. Cook the onions & mushrooms until the mushrooms have started to release some liquid. Probably 10 - 15 minutes for this quantity.
1. While the mushrooms are cooking down, in a skillet, add 1 cup of the vegetable broth over high heat.
1. When the broth boils, turn the temperature down, and add the sliced portabellos.
1. Add some cracked black pepper to both of the mushroom concotions.
1. Continue to cook both things of the mushrooms, adding more liquid if necessary. Stir them from time to time so they don't burn or stick.
1. The portobellos should eventually yield a thickish mushroom broth that is super yummy. When that happens, turn off the heat, and set them aside.
1. Once the large pot of mushrooms have cooked down and have given up their goodness, add the miso broth, the soy milk, and 2 cups of the vegetable broth. Bring back to a simmer.
1. Add the vegan sour cream, and stir in.
1. Grab a container with a lid that seals well, that holds about a cup or so of liquid.
1. In that container, put in about a &frac12; cup of vegetable broth, and 1 T of the potato starch. Shake it up until the potato starch is all incorporated. It doesn't take much.
1. Pour the starch into the soup. Stir it in relatively quickly. Give it a minute or 2 and test the thickness. If you want it thicker, make up another slurry with broth and starch, and do it again. Keep going until you get the desired thickness.
1. Pour in the big portobellos, and be sure to get all of the liquid out of the skillet. You can use some vegetable broth to deglaze that pan if anything stuck. Get all the good stuff!
1. Stir, scoop, & enjoy.

## Notes

This is more or less how I made it, but I didn't measure anything. I reverse engineered the recipe based on the empty containers, and the relative emptiness of the non-empty conainters.

Potato starch goes a long way. You can easily turn this into a giant brick of mushroom goo if you go too crazy with it. If it does get too thick, but is still stirable, then add more broth.

You can substitute a different starch if you want -- cornstarch would probably work, but would likely require more. You could use flour, but I was shooting to make it gluten free.

For mushrooms, the first time I made this, I did about &frac12; sliced white button mushrooms and &frac12; sliced baby bellas. Mix it up as you feel like it.

If you wanted to make it soy free, you could replace the soy milk with almond milk, and the miso with more vegetable broth.

You could make it oil free by just omitting the vegan butter (or coconut oil) and cooking everything with additional broth to start out.
