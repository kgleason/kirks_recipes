A realtively thick, slightly smoky, slightly sweet sloppy joe.
<!--TEASER_END-->
##Ingredients
 * 1 lb dry green lentils
 * 1 qt low-sodium organic vegetable stock
 * 1 T olive oil
 * 1 medium onion, minced
 * 1 T minced garlic
 * 1 large bell pepper, color of your choosing, minced
 * &frac12; cup ketchup
 * &frac12; cup miso or vegetarian worcestshire sauce
 * 2 T tomato paste
 * 3 T maple syrup
 * 1 T chile powder
 * 1 T smoked paprika
 * 1 15oz can crushed fire-roasted tomato

##Bringing it all together

 1. Add the lentils and the vegetable stock to a pan with a tight fitting lid. Bring to a boil. Let the lentils simmer for 20 - 30 minutes. If the liquid all dries up, then add some water. Boil the lentils until they are al dente. If there is extra liquid after they are cooked, drain the lentils in a colander.
 1. While the lentils are cooking, heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil to the warmed skillet, and add the onion, pepper, and garlic. Cook until the onions are soft.
 1. Add the rest of the ingredients to the onion mixture, and continue to simmer until the lentils are all cooked.
 1. Add all of the lentils to the rest of the mixture (or vice versa). Stir to combine.
